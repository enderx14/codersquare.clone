# codersquare.clone
a clone of https://github.com/yebrahim/codersquare for learning purposes 
A social web app for sharing learning resources in a hackernews-style experience. I'm building this publicly on my YouTube channel, contributions are welcome, feel free to send a PR or open an issue.

The stack is Javascript all the way, try cloning this repo, running npm install and npm start inside the server directory. See the wireframes, PRD and ERD in the docs directory for the desired experience.
